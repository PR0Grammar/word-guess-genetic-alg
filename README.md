### What's a genetic algorithm?

Genetic algorithms are used to solve optimization problems (ie. figuring out a word). The model is inspired by Darwin's Theory of Natural Selection. The basic idea is to create an initial "population" that will crossover and mutate over multiple generations. The crossover allows two participants in our population to exchange "alleles"(properties) to create a child for the next generation. Mutations of these alleles can occur as well. Ideally, one of the generations will contain the "fittest gene" that we want.
